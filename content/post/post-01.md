### Oh, hi there!

I mainly put this site together as a means to enable an evergreen and permanent place to keep my resume. In building the site I realized how much I like writing about technology. This discovery has prompted expanding the site into an actual blog, powered by [hugo](https://gohugo.io), [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the [ananke](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke) theme.

Expect more articles in the next few weeks as I start working through the backlog of ideas, projects, outages and generally interesting technology-related topics.

To see sample projects visit [my github profile](https://github.com/jreslock)

That's all for now. Come back soon for more content. I plan to post at least twice a month.
